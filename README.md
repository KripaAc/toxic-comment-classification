# Toxic Comment Classification System

This project implements a **machine learning model** to detect toxic comments, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify comments as toxic or non-toxic. The goal is to assist in filtering online platforms for improved user experience by identifying toxic behavior.

## Problem Statement
Online platforms frequently encounter toxic comments, which can negatively impact users. This project aims to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic, providing a foundation for applications that can automatically moderate content.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge** dataset, which includes a labeled collection of comments categorized as toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate, and severe toxicity. The dataset is divided into:
- `train.csv`: Training data with labeled comments
- `test.csv`: Test data without labels
- `test_labels.csv`: Labels for the test data
- `sample_submission.csv`: Submission format for the competition

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using TF-IDF to convert comments into numerical features.
2. **Handling Imbalance**: To address class imbalance, oversampling techniques were applied to improve model performance on minority classes.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models (such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest) were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.
4. **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on identifying toxic comments effectively.

## Results
The final model demonstrates high accuracy and precision in identifying toxic comments, making it suitable for real-world applications in online content moderation.

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements include experimenting with deep learning models like LSTM and BERT for higher accuracy and handling large datasets more effectively.
